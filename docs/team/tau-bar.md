### Project: gitGud

gitGud is a desktop application for managing friends' gaming information. gitGud uses a simple Graphical User Interface
(GUI) combined with an optimized Command Line Interface (CLI) to give you a smooth and efficient experience. If you can
type fast enough, gitGud can get you contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI-based applications.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete friends.
    * What it does: allows the user to delete a friend from gitGud using the friend's unique `FRIEND_ID`
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can easily delete a friend from
      gitGud in the event that they made a mistake in the details or simply wishes to remove a friend.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=tau-bar&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zFR=false&tabAuthor=MarcusTXK&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)
