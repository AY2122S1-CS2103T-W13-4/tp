### Project: gitGud

#### What is gitGud?

[gitGud](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-w13-4.github.io/tp/) is a desktop application for storing and managing friends' gaming
information and schedules. It is dedicated to gamers and provides a gamer-themed experience with a focus on increasing
the user's efficiency through its typing-based interface.

       - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is now able to view all the information
       about a friend at one place, which includes the schedule, all the games that friend plays, their respective in-game
       usernames and the skill level.

    1. Refactor `Friend` to keep track of the `GameFriendLink`s in the form of a Map instead of the traditional Set used in AB3.
    2. Purge `find` command from the codebase. Replace with `--list` subcommand.
