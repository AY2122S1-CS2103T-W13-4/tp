### Project: gitGud

#### What is gitGud?

gitGud is a desktop application for managing friends' gaming information. gitGud uses a simple Graphical User Interface
(GUI) combined with an optimized Command Line Interface (CLI) to give you a smooth and efficient experience. If you can
type fast enough, gitGud can get you contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI-based applications.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to get a friend contact.
    * What it does: allows the user to get all information linked to a friend contact.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is now able to view all the information
      about a friend at one place, which includes all the games and the respective in-game ids.
