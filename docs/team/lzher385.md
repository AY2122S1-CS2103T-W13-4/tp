### Project: gitGud

gitGud is a desktop application for managing friends' gaming information. gitGud uses a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) combined with an optimized Command Line Interface (CLI) to give you a smooth and efficient experience. If you can type fast enough, gitGud can get you contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI-based applications.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to link a friend with a game he/she plays.
  * What it does: allows the user to associate a friend in his contact list with a game that was previously recorded.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is able to note down what games his/her friends play.
  
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `get --friend` and `get --game`.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added glossary for gitGud.
    * Added user story for `link` feature.
