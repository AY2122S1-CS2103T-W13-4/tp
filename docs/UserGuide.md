## Features

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `game --get GAME_ID`, `GAME_ID` is a parameter which can be used as `game --get CSGO`.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `-n Marcus Tang -n Taufiq`, only `-n Taufiq` will be taken.
