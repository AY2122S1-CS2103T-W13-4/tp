## What is gitGud? 

gitGud is a desktop application for managing friends' gaming information. 
<br />It uses a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) combined with an optimized Command Line Interface (CLI) to give you a smooth and efficient experience. 
<br />If you can type fast enough, gitGud can get you contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI-based applications.
